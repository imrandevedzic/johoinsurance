Quotation and Application Module April MyHealth International

 

Tip 1: Check our step by step instruction how to apply
Tip 2: The online module does not show all possible covers you can issue (5 covers) but only 2 or 3 of them. When you get to the point where the module shows the premiums you can click on the little green triangle right above the premium to show other covers. 

Tip 3: we know most of our clients are not interested in the "death and total irreversible loss of autonomy and income benefits insurances" which can be part of this insurance package, however the online application module will ask you if you want to issue those insurances . If you don’t want that you can just click the button ‘I am not interested’ on the right part of the page and you will apply for healthcare / dental (optional) only. 

Tip 4: You can always calculate premiums in the module online (and you should as we cannot provide quotes on behalf of you), but if the online application module does not work to actually apply for the insurance you can also apply for an insurance using an applicationform and healthquestionnaire in pdf. You can fill out the forms online in your pdf program, so no need to print / scan. Fill out the forms completely and email them back to us (info@johoinsurances.org) Important! Add a copy of your passport in the email!
